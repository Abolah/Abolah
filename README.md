# Hi, I’m Abolah

# Who am I ?

I’m a Sysadmin👨🏻‍💻 (with a Masters Degree) with a passion for starting and never finishing side projects.

# What do I like to do ?

I’m a huge nerd so I like to play video games🕹️ (but I’m bad at it), watch Esports🖥️ and spend an unhealthy amount of time in front of a computer screen to either code, fix my servers😠💻, play or watch something. All of this while drinking coffee☕.

# Do I have any passions?

I’m insanely passionate about cryptocurrencies, how they work, what they could bring, the downsides and all the emerging technologies that they bring in their trails.

I also really enjoy to go fishing 🎣.
